Welcome to my second Tableau End to End Project repository! ðŸš€

This project demonstrates additional practice with Tableau, focusing on key features such as selecting specific worksheets, utilizing the "Show Me" feature, and creating heat maps. The goal is to enhance data visualization skills and gain deeper insights through effective dashboard design.
